Very smart way to eliminate the duplicate.
Here is my understanding about the eliminate process.

After several times of append and other operations,
#here I just pay attention to one element, 2's position in the inner list
We get the current list like below:

    1. [2,x,x,x]
    2. [x,2,x,x]
    3. [x,x,2,x]
    4. [x,x,x,2]
        Of course if we replace the "x" with other elements, there should be several other lists in each row,but the position of "2" should just be same,[0],[1],[2],[3] for each row.
        The approach will traverse each list and insert the new element.
        If the new element is "2", the current "for loop" will break.
        Therefor,after the two loops,the "2" 's position in the list should be:
        [0,1]
        [0,2],[1,2]
        [0,3],[1,3],[2,3]
        [0,4],[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]
        It will actually cover all the situation of the two 2's distribution.
```
